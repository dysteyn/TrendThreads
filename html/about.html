            <h1>About the Developer</h1>
            <p>My name is Justine B. Bracero, a 21-year-old currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Entertainment and Multimedia Computing, majoring in Game Development, at the University of Caloocan City. This program has significantly enhanced my skills in various areas, including UI/UX design and 3D modeling. Through hands-on projects and collaboration with peers, I've developed a strong foundation in creating engaging and user-friendly gaming experiences. The course has also provided me with opportunities to work with industry-standard tools and software, further preparing me for a successful career in game development.</p>
